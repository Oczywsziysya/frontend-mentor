## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS clamp
- Native CSS nesting


### Continued development

* Write semantically correct HTML.
* Write clean and concise CSS code.
* Learn more about fluid layouts the techniques to implement them.
* Learn more about the mix-blend-mode property (without this, the color overlay in this project wouldn't look as intended).
