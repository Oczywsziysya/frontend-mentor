## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I read some articles about modern CSS features that are well supported on modern browsers and learned about a few things, like nested selectors to improve readability, media-queries inside selectors (which is close to what I've been doing for the last few projects, wish I knew that was possible before), and finally learned to use the clamp() function for fluid layouts and typography and now I understand why some people consider it to be such a game changer, it's just much better than creating a lot of media-queries. For this project in specific, I used it mainly for paddings and typography and it scales so much better, there are no font-size jumps, and the code is much more concise and clean. 

### Continued development

* Write semantically correct HTML.
* Write clean and concise CSS code.
* Learn more about techniques for making truly fluid layouts that scale much better.
* Learn about container-queries and when should they be used instead of media-queries.
