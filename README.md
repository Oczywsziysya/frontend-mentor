# Frontend Mentor Challenges

## Introduction
Frontend Mentor is a website that offers the opportunity to work on real-world front-end projects and give/receive feedback from an active community. It provides all the necessary assets and even Figma/Sketch design files for premium users. It's a great way to practice what you've learned and escape the infamous tutorial hell.

## My experience
I used to have one repository for each individual challenge, but once the number of challenges gets big enough, the GitHub profile starts to get a little overpopulated and messy, so it's probably better to have it all in one place.

For some projects I tried to create pixel-perfect pages and it's very rewarding and satisfying to see that the website you've just made almost perfectly matches the intended design, but I think we can all agree that it's way too time consuming, especially when you're still grasping the basics and have so much more to learn, it's not worth the hassle, in my opinion. So, from now on (#17 and beyond), I'll still try to make it look as similar as possible, but without bothering that much.

As for the details of the projects' execution, I try to document everything that I find interesting/important in the README files, just a way of sharing, showcasing and keeping track of the things I learn.

All the HTML, CSS and JS are written by me and me alone. The only thing that is provided beforehand is the raw text and a basic HTML boilerplate. There's also a brief style guide with the colors and fonts that should be used.

## Projects

**PS:** The numbers have absolutely nothing to do with Frontend Mentor itself, they simply represent the order in which I completed the challenges.
